    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="fulp">
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a medium saucepan, cover potatoes with water by 1/2"; <p>season with 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until potatoes are fork-tender,</p> <p>12 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes; set aside in colander.</p></li>
        <li>In same pot over medium-low heat, cook half-and-half and butter, stirring until <p>butter is melted. Return potatoes to pot. Mash potatoes with a potato masher or a fork. Stir in 1</p> <p>tablespoon parsley; season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat.</p></li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add beef; <p>season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Break up beef with a wooden spoon and cook until crumbled and no longer pink,</p> <p> 6 to 8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a plate. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons beef drippings.</p></li>
        <li>In same skillet over medium heat, cook onion and carrots, stirring, until onions begin to soften, 5 to 6 minutes.<p> Add garlic, rosemary, and thyme and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 2 minutes more.</p> <p>Return beef and accumulated juices to skillet; stir in tomato paste. Cook, stirring, until tomato paste turns dark red,</p><p>3 to 4 minutes. Add wine and cook, stirring, until almost completely evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.</p><p> Stir in broth and Worcestershire and bring to a simmer. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in corn and peas.</p></li>
        <li>Pour beef mixture into a 13" x 9" pan and dollop mashed potatoes on top. <p>Lightly spray a rubber spatula with cooking spray and spread potatoes over beef mixture. Sprinkle with Parmesan; season with a pinch of pepper.</p></li>
        <li>Bake shepherd's pie until beef mixture is bubbling, about 25 minutes. <p>Remove from oven. Place a rack in upper third of oven and turn broiler to high. Broil until top begins to brown, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
        <li>Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.</li>
